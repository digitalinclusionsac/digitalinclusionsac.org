I"<<p>The Broadband Access and Adoption working group will focus on supporting the expansion of broadband availability and subscribership to high-speed internet services in the Sacramento Region, including expanding access to unserved households, public access computing labs, and beyond public spaces. To achieve these goals, the coalition identifies internet access needs and barriers, and makes internet resources and services available to the community, with emphasis on vulnerable populations.</p>

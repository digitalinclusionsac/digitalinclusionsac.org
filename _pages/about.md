subtitle: The Sacramento Coalition for Digital Inclusion
---
Discussions which formed the beginnings of the Sacramento Coalition for Digital Inclusion began in the fall of 2018 inspired by a [Brookings Institution report](https://www.valleyvision.org/resources/brookings-charting-a-course-to-the-sacramento-regions-future-economic-prosperity-2018/) on the strengths and weaknesses of the Sacramento Capital region.  A series of community discussions occurred to organize around the mission of digital equity, with the Sacramento Public Library hosting the Sacramento Digital Inclusion Summit in January 2019. This led to the creation of the Sacramento Coalition for Digital Inclusion, with more than 40 members, led by a Steering Committee comprised of the City of Sacramento, the Sacramento Public Library, Valley Vision and Social Ventures Partners. During 2019, the Coalition built collaborative relationships, conducted assessments of needs including through community engagement, and produced an initial report focused on increasing digital access, both to affordable Internet and devices, and digital literacy/skills. The City of Sacramento passed a resolution in October 2019 to launch National Digital Inclusion Week in the region.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 , the work of the Coalition became even more important and the need for a funding mechanism to drive forward momentum and staff this increasingly important body of work required an urgent solution.  Valley Vision has been successful in securing short term funding to continue and expand this valuable work through the Morgan Family Foundation and Union Bank, on behalf of community partners and stakeholders.

## Featured Digital Inclusion Stories

![A woman at the North Sacramento workshop has been trying to learn Photoshop and photo editing skills. She wants to do digital photography, but has not had the correct learning opportunity. A staff member with Sacramento Employment Training Agency repeatedly stresses to her clients that résumés created on a smartphone are often inferior to those composed on a full PC. A resident of the Delta continues to run, to his dissatisfaction, his work email from an @frontier.com email address because he cannot figure out how to migrate his email from one service to another. These instances, drawn from our workshops, illustrate how skills, hardware and connectivity inequities create digital divisions in the lives of Sacramento community members. The recommended actions proposed in this report seek to address issues like the ones described above, in an inclusive and comprehensive fashion. ](/assets/uploads/digitalequity.jpg "Digital inequity disrupts one’s social, economic, and democratic life")

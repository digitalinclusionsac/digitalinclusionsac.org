The Broadband Access and Adoption Group focuses on increasing availability of broadband infrastructure and subscribership to high-speed internet services in the Sacramento Region, including expanding access to unserved households, public access computing labs, and beyond public spaces. To achieve these goals, the coalition combines resources from the members to make them available to the community, especially to vulnerable populations.

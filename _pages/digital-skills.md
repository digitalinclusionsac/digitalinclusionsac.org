The Digital Literacy/Digital Skills working group will advocate for demand driven, skill building investments to improve the lives of students, job seekers and community members to meaningfully engage in civic life.  This group will identify where skill building gaps exist, bring forward best practice models for replication, and support efforts to ensure our region’s skills are competitive and inclusive.

Interested in participating in the Digital Literacy/Digital Skills working group? Please contact Renee John, [renee.john@valleyvision.org](mailto:renee.john@valleyvision.org).
